            <h2>Reflection and Analysis</h2>
            <p>For my data set I chose data on Amazon sales. Amazon is a website that I use frequently to buy things like daily necessities, clothes, jewelry and everything in between. Their sales and revenue are areas that I am really interested in learning more about, so making visuals out of the available information was really interesting to me. I luckily did not run into any errors when it came to uploading the data set, and I had a really smooth experience inputting the data into Tableau. For the design choices, I tried to choose graphs that best conveyed the information I was trying to highlight. To me, the bar graphs made the most sense to showcase the revenue by product and Average price by category. The bar graph made it simple to see which products had the highest prices, and which had the highest revenues. The line chart was useful to show revenue over time, and showed Amazon’s revenue over the course of a year. These visualizations are how I would want the information to be presented to me, based on how I learn best. The patterns on this graph surprised me a little bit. I was especially surprised to see that there really wasn’t a large difference in the revenue brought in by the different categories of products. I expected there to be more variance when it came to the different products and the revenue they brought in for Amazon. I was also surprised that the sports category brought in the same revenue as things like beauty, fashion and home&kitchen. In my experience, Amazon has been really useful for fashion and home&kitchen products, but I had never thought to buy sports related products from them. So seeing sports bringing in very similar revenue to the other categories definitely surprised me a little bit. Overall, there were no real outliers when it came to the data on the different product categories, they all brought in relatively similar revenue. I was also surprised to see that the highest revenue month was January and not December. I figured since the holidays are a really popular shopping time that December would easily have the highest overall revenue. February had the lowest overall revenue, which also surprised me because of Valentine's day. Amazon is a quick and convenient website to get last minute gifts off of, so I figured February might be higher in overall total revenue then they ended up being. Some questions to explain outliers could be what do Amazon’s competitors offer that hinders their performance in home&kitchen sales? And what factors lead to the increase of revenue in January? I think Tableau is a very effective visualization tool. It makes graphs clean and simple, and very visually appealing. Some other tools can make graph making complicated and confusing, but Tableau makes it to the point and offers several different visualization options. The tool gives you a lot of creative freedom while also providing enough structure that it is extremely easy to use. I didn’t run into any limitations while using Tableau, I had a very smooth overall experience.
