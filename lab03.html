            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>After exploring the different data visualization galleries, I picked an infographic that interests me from Information is Beautiful. This infographic was showcasing how the world’s economy has grown about 45 times in 50 years. This caught my eye because it seemed like a big claim, with a small infographic that did not have many details. When it comes to how Tufte describes information resolution, I would say that the infographic that I chose has very low information resolution. The infographic makes a large claim about the economy, while only showing two data points, which doesn’t cover enough information. The article sums 50 years of data into two small bullet points, without showing any sort of timeline inbetween. In my opinion, there is also some key missing information in the article that is not displayed on the infographic. The article does not show how much the population has grown, which is a key factor in how much the economy has grown. The graph also fails to show variance within that growth, like poverty and inequality.</p>

            <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
            <p>My first concern about this graph is effects without causes. This infographic is a great example of effects without causes in Tufte’s terms. In the article, Tufte talked about how bullet points can be misleading. When information is stated on a visualization without the web of how you got there, these bullet points can be hard for users to follow and truly comprehend. He explained how bullet points that are vague leave a lot to the imagination, and not a lot of information about what went into the statement being made on the visualization. The visualization I chose made a very broad statement about the world’s economic growth, showing an almost 45x growth from 1968 and 2018. However, the infographic failed to provide any sort of reasoning for why this growth occurred. The infographic didn’t mention anything like technological advancements, population growth, or economic development. These are major factors that contribute to an economic growth as big as the one shown in the infographic. Exactly as Tufte was saying, bullet points can be vague and hard to understand. These points of information provided on the graph are extremely vague and show no web for viewers to understand how the author arrived at this conclusion.</p>

            <h3>Cherry Picking</h3>
            <p>My next additional concern with this infographic is cherry picking. Tufte talks a lot about cherry picking in his article, and he calls it the most serious obstacle in the path of learning the truth. Cherry picking can be misleading for viewers of these visualizations, since it involves selecting certain information that highlights exactly what the author wants the viewers to see. The article and the infographic point to economic growth equaling human growth and automatically being good for the population. However, the infographic fails to show the whole story. It shows merely two dates of information, 1968 and 2018. It fails to show any years in between, and any costs that it took to get to this level of economic growth. The infographic doesn’t show any averages of income, or measures of well being.</p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, the visualization presents economic growth in an effective and visually appealing way. However, I do think there are some key insights missing, and that the graphic would benefit from more information. Including key metrics like population growth, and advancements in technology would really help viewers understand this massive leap of growth in the last 50 years. Without including these aspects, the infographic is missing crucial information.</p>
