            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For my AI tools to experiment with for this lab, I chose to use Gemini and Adobe Firefly. Gemini is an AI tool that I have previous experience with, and have used in my everyday life. Adobe Firefly is a tool that is entirely new to me, and I thought it could be interesting to explore with AI image generation since as it’s gotten more popular has been something that interests me.

            <h2>Tool 1: Adobe Firefly</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>While using Adobe Firefly, I decided to have some fun and see what it could do with prompts involving the TCU mascot. I started by prompting it to make the TCU mascot on a beach in Hawaii. I was a little bit surprised at how the mascot turned out, it looked more like a purple onesie than a TCU horned frog. The tool did a really good job depicting a realistic looking beach in Hawaii, but definitely fell short when it came to making the TCU mascot look accurate. I also told the tool to make an image of the TCU horned frog using VS code. This one was pretty cool to see. The horned frog was wearing a TCU jersey and looked much more accurate than the first TCU mascot the tool had produced. The image also showed the frog using VS code on a laptop, which I thought was kind of fun!</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>After exploring the tool and its features, I feel like an appropriate use of this tool would be for teachers to use it to make fun graphics. Or even for people in marketing roles to use it to generate creative advertisements.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>When it comes to some potential ethical considerations of this tool, AI generated images can produce offensive or harmful content if not monitored closely. To address this, Adobe uses filters and deny lists to attempt to stop harmful content from being created.

            <h2>Tool 2: Gemini</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>The next AI tool I used was Gemini. I have had experience with Gemini in the past, so this tool wasn’t new to me. It was cool to experiment with it and see what this tool could do for me when it came to coding. First, I told Gemini that I was starting a new project in VS code. I asked the tool to give me the base code for my html file. It gave me a base code to use that I could copy and paste, and it also told me about a shortcut, that if I type an ! it will generate a base code for me in html. My next prompt was telling Gemini that I have a school project and part of it is to experiment with AI. I asked Gemini what cool ways I could use the tool to experiment with AI. It provided me with a list of ideas like making my own website with vibe coding, creating a guided learning tutor, or to use it for research. Gemini was really good about giving helpful and speedy responses, some of these responses going above and beyond. Like when I asked for code and Gemini gave me the code and also informed me of a way to do it in VS code. I didn’t notice much falling short with the prompts I used.</p>
            
            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p> Based on what I saw, I think Gemini could be an appropriate tool to use to aid learning and in your everyday life. It could be helpful for discovering new things about an unfamiliar area, and even help aid learning by summarizing notes and articles.</p>
            
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
        <p>When it comes to potential ethical considerations with the tool, there have been issues of potential privacy violation. To address this, google provides controls where you can manage your privacy through Gemini.

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>In my own life, I have found AI can be really helpful to streamline learning. If I am really confused on a topic I have AI explain it to me and walk me through it step by step. AI could help the DCDA program by aiding students learning as a tutor, but could harm it with academic dishonesty. Overall when used correctly, AI can be a great tool to help aid learning.
